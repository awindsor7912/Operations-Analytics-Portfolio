# Case Study: Personalized Billing Operations Dashboard
**Technology:** Power BI | SharePoint Online | Power Automate

## 📑 Overview
This dashboard serves as the primary operational interface for Administrators and Management. Integrated directly into a SharePoint Online web part, it provides a "Single Pane of Glass" view into the Workflow Queue, allowing users to manage their daily workloads without navigating complex list structures.

## 🛡️ Security & Data Governance
The standout feature of this solution is the implementation of Row-Level Security (RLS) and role-based access controls to maintain strict data privacy and governance:
* **Personalized User Experience:** Utilizing RLS, the dashboard identifies the logged-in user and displays a personalized "Welcome Back" message.
* **Dynamic Filtering:** Specialists are presented only with work items assigned specifically to them, ensuring a focused, clutter-free workspace.
* **Access Hierarchy:** * **Standard Users:** Restricted to "My Pending" (Active) and "My Archive" (Past 60 days) views.
  * **Supervisors/Managers/Analysts:** Granted elevated permissions to visualize the entire enterprise backlog, team-wide distribution, and historical trends for resource planning.

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture
* **Data Source:** Direct connection to the SharePoint Invoice Processing Queue list.
* **Relational Logic:** Links operational status, area assignments, and financial totals to provide a comprehensive view of work order health.
* **UX/UI Design:** High-contrast "Obsidian/Ironwood" aesthetic designed for low-fatigue monitoring during high-volume processing windows.

## 📈 Operational Impact
By embedding this dashboard into the SharePoint home page, the system provides immediate visibility into the Estimated Total Unbilled amounts by region and status, enabling specialists to prioritize high-value items effectively.
